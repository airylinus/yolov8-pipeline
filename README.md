# yolov8-pipeline

This repository implements a tool which can be used to generate a YOLOv8 dataset from a set of images and annotations created by X-AnyLabeling ( https://github.com/CVHub520/X-AnyLabeling ).



## Usage

> .\data-prepare.bat D:\dataset\apple-orange-banana-detection

You'll get a folder named `yolodata` in the directory `D:\dataset\apple-orange-banana-detection\yolodata`, which contains the all files needed for training YOLOv8.
